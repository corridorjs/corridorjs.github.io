CorridorJS
==========

## Waterloo Regions newest JavaScript meetup##

[CorridorJS]() is a monthly meeting of JavaScript developers which happens on the third Thursday of each month in the 
upstairs event space at [Communitech](https://www.communitech.ca/), in the Tannery building in
downtown Kitchener. Each month, a handful of presenters give short talks about
cool technology projects.

Tickets cost $10 and are released in two batches, both on Fridays at 10am one
and two weeks before the event. [Follow @corridorJS on Twitter](http://twitter.com/corridorJS) for
timely notifications about tickets, amid other blatherings.

This repository serves two primary purposes:

1. Talks are proposed via Git pull requests; just add your talk
to <a href="index.html">index.html</a>. Anybody who proposes a talk gets early priority
access to ticket sales for that month regardless of whether the talk is accepted.

2. For accounting purposes, [budget.js](budget.js) contains an exhaustive historical log
of all funds raised. All proceeds are donated to worthwhile local charities.

Hope to see you next time!
